The code in this directory is included because my intention is to
eventually provide support for PGP messaging, compatible with PGP 5.x.
However, as of the time of writing (January 1998), I haven't even run
this code in months, and it may not work at all.  Once I've finished a
first version of a Python ssh implementation, I'll then return to
working on PGP support.

The original README was:
========================
This is version 0.02 of the Python/PGP (PyPGP) distribution.  It
contains Python classes and modules that read and write PGP-format
files.  A PGP binary is not required to encrypt and decrypt PGP
messages.

The doc/ subdirectory contains the documentation.

Most of the code in version 0.01 was discarded and rewritten afresh,
starting from new code written by Mark Shuttleworth of Thawte
Consulting (http://XXX)
