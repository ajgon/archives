	Things to do:

	* Are all the parse_bin and write_bin methods completely implemented?

	* Documentation : table of packet classes and their public attributes

	* Signatures aren't yet implemented.

	* There's no high-level interface to PGP messaging, with callbacks
to retrieve keys.  

	Medium-term things:

	* I've punted on the problem of random number generation, and
just read from Linux's /dev/urandom device all the time.

	* Use RSAREF if available, to avoid getting in trouble with RSADSI

	Longer-term, once things have stablized:

	* Add more algorithms: 3DES, SHA, ElGamal, ...  (Suggestions?)

	* A GUI interface to PGP encryption written in Tkinter.
