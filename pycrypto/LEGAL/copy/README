Historically, the copyright licensing status of the Python Cryptography
Toolkit ("PyCrypto") has been somewhat ambiguous.  The original intention of
Andrew M. Kuchling and other contributors has been to dedicate PyCrypto to the
public domain, but the original license may not have allowed distributing
modified versions, depending on one's interpretation of the word "use" (see
LICENSE.orig).

Additionally, some files within PyCrypto have specified their own licenses,
which differed from the PyCrypto license itself.  For example, the original
RIPEMD.c module simply had a copyright statement and warranty disclaimer,
without clearly licensing anything.

Recently, there has been an effort to clarify the situation.  A multi-faceted
approach has been taken with regard to ambiguously or incompatibly licensed
code, including:

- Asking contributors to clarify their original intentions or to clearly and
  explicitly dedicate their contributions to the public domain;

- Writing new code from scratch as a replacement;

- Using clearly-licensed code from other sources; and

- Removing the code without replacing it.

Where contributors have responded to a request to clarify their intentions,
their statements have been recorded in this directory.

The "stmts" directory contains contributors' statements.
