- Clean up and stabilize the Crypto.PublicKey API.  The previous attempt to
  unify fundamentally different algorithms, such as RSA and DSA, should be
  avoided, since it simply adds confusion.

- Add algorithms:
    - Camellia
    - SHA512
    - Diffie-Hellmen key agreement
    - Authenticated Diffie-Hellmen key agreement
    - RSA PKCS#1 v1.5
    - RSA PKCS#1 v2 (OAEP)

- Add a *complete* DSA implementation. (The current implementation doesn't do
  the necessary hashing, for example.)

- Coverage testing

- Separate the exported API from the internal implementation details.

- Provide drop-in support for extensions/drivers like amkCrypto/mxCrypto.
  There should be some way to register these drivers in your package, e.g. by
  defining a certain subdirectory to be a place where pycrypto looks for these
  drivers at startup time.

Documentation:
- Document chaff/winnow better
- Add more docstrings.
- Document the functions and macros for adding a new algorithm
    Hash functions:
  hash_init(), hash_copy(), DIGEST_SIZE, hash_update(), hash_digest()
    Block functions:
  ...
