*Experimental stuff!* In your model:

    admin do

        column <column> :visible => true|false,                              # column IS NOT visible and IS NOT posted
                        :protected => true|false,                            # column   IS   visible and IS NOT posted
                        :hidden => true|false,                               # column IS NOT visible but   IS   posted
                        :image => true|false,                                # in index and show view, content gets class="image" and it's wrapped in <img src="" /> tag
                        :class => 'class_name',                              # in index and show view, content wrapper gets specified class
                        :value => lambda {|column_value| ... },              # in index and show view, column value is processed by block
                        :country => true|{:codes => true|false},             # in edit and add display field as a list of countries (with codes = true - option values are country codes)
                        :state => {:country => US|CA, :codes => true|false}, # same as for country, but show states
                        :wysiwyg => true|false,                              # display field as a rich text editor (using TinyMCE)
                        :password => true|false,                             # display field as password field
                        :paperclip => true|false,                            # only if Paperclip Gem is used - treat column as paperclip column (remember to use "virtual" paperclip column name)
                        :before => :column_name,                             # display this column before specified column (used for virtual columns)
                        :after => :column_name,                              # like :before, but after ;)
                        :replace => :column_name                             # pretty self-explainatory

        hide_protected_rows                        # If provided all protected columns will also be invisible (:visible => false)
        disabled_actions [:new, :create, :etc]     # REST actions disabled for this model
        additional_actions [:approve, :etc]        # Additional actions for this model
        columns_order [:column_3, :column_5, :etc] # Table with column names in correct order, all visble columns not included there will be show at the end
